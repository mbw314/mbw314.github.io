<p>
There are several related definitions, but let us say that a <i>circle packing</i> is a collection of circles in the plane
whose interiors do not overlap. This page demonstrates an algorithm to create a random circle packing with the added property
that no circle in the packing can be enlarged without creating an overlap. The basic idea is to build the packing one circle at
a time, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy</a> fashion, meaning each circle is made to be as
large as possible given the previously existing circles. There is a built-in overall maximum radius size, and a maximum number
of circles allowed in the circle packing.
</p>

<p>
In a bit more detail, once a center point for a new circle is randomly selected, its circle is given a small radius, in this
case 1 pixel. Then the radius is iteratively increased according to the following logic.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the circle is tangent to 0 other circles
    <ul>
      <li>increase the radius until the circle is tangent to another circle, or until the radius reaches the maximum allowable radius</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if the circle is tangent to 1 or 2 other circles
    <ul>
      <li>increase the radius and move the center while maintaining tangency,
        until the circle is tangent to another circle, or until the radius reaches the maximum allowable radius</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
In the case where the circle is tangent to 1 other circle, as the radius increases, the center point moves along the straight line joining
the two centers. In the case where the circle is tangent to 2 other circles, as the radius increases, the center point moves in a more
complicated way. Namely, if the center is \((x,y)\) and the proposed radius is \(r\), and the tangent circles have centers
\((x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2)\) and radii  \(r_1, r_2\),
then \((x,y)\) is determined by the other data by solving two equations that determine tangency:
\[
\begin{align*}
(x-x_1)^2 + (y-y_1)^2 &= (r+r_1)^2 \\
(x-x_2)^2 + (y-y_2)^2 &= (r+r_2)^2
\end{align*}
\]
The resulting expressions for \(x\) and \(y\) are messy and highly non-linear, but closed-form. This non-linearity introduces the possibility
that the center moves "too quickly" and that the circle will end up overlapping another circle, even if the change in radius is very small.
Care was needed to avoid this, but the solution isn't perfect. (Look closely and you might find a few cases where some circles have a small overlap.)
</p>

<p>
There are three visualization modes for the circle packing: (1) simple, meaning just the circles are drawn; (2) simple, but with
connections between tangent circles drawn (e.g., this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_graph">tangency graph</a>
of the circle packing), and (3) circles represented by randomly colored disks.
